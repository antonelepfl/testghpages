# Morphology Tools

#### NeuroM

<span class="s1">NeuroM provides a range of morphometric analyses that allow a user to quantify properties of a neuron's axonal and dendritic morphology, and yields features that are used in the classification of the 55 m-types. NeuroM is being continuously developed on github.</span>

#### NeuroR

NeuroR identifies and repairs arbours that have been cut during slice preparation. _Available later_.

#### NeuroC

NeuroC generates clones of the repaired neurons by introducting statistical variations in the arbours of each clone. _Available later_.

# Electrophysiology Tools

#### eFEL

The Electrophys Feature Extraction Library (eFEL) allows neuroscientists to automatically extract features from time series data recorded from neurons (both in vitro and in silico). Examples are the action potential width and amplitude in voltage traces recorded during whole-cell patch clamp experiments. The user of the library provides a set of traces and selects the features to be calculated. The library will then extract the requested features and return the values to the user.

An IPython notebook example showing eFEL using one of the neuron model downloadable from this website is available here:

#### BluePyOpt

The BlueBrain Python Optimisation Library (BluePyOpt) is an extensible framework for data-driven model parameter optimisation that wraps and standardises several existing open-source tools. It simplifiesÂ the task of creating and sharing these optimisations, and the associated techniques and knowledge. This is achieved by abstracting the optimisation and evaluation tasks into various reusable and flexible discrete elements according to established best-practices. Further, BluePyOpt provides methods for setting up both small- and large-scale optimisations on a variety of platforms, ranging from laptops to Linux clusters and cloud-based compute infrastructures.
